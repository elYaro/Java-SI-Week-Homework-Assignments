Exercise: Designing the BankManager application
Now it's your turn, open IntelliJ and start a new project called BankManager that will contain the following classes:

CheckingAccount
SavingsAccount
CertificateOfDeposit
Make sure they all extend from the same class called BankAccount that includes all the common fields.

Don't worry about implementing any of the methods for now, just leave them all blank. This exercise is mainly focusing on designing the code rather than writing any logic code.
